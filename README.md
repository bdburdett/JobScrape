# JobScrape

This script will run with indeed.com to find the 40 most recent jobs for any career field and location you are interested in. You can automate with AWS EC2 and S3 to generate a file on whatever time schedule you prefer to drop a CSV into the bucket. Otherwise will generate a CSV each time for quick reference.
